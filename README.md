# Twitter Classifier
A pretty simple tweet classification web application I made to learn a bit more about Natural Language Processing

Uses a Naive Bayes Classifier to understand positive/negative sentiment in a given tweet

Provides users with a single webpage, where they can fetch tweets on a given desired keyword (or string of words) via an AJAX request.
 
The Users are then returned the actual stream tweets with the results of each tweet's sentiment analysis
